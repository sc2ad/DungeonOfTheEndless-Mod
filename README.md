# DungeonOfTheEndless-Mod

This is a compilation of some mods that I use for DotE and the framework to support them.

## Tutorial

There are a few steps that you must take in order to properly use these mods.

### Setup

**PLEASE FOLLOW THIS AS BEST AS YOU CAN, IF YOU DO NOT, THE MODS WON'T LOAD AND YOU MAY HAVE TO REINSTALL YOUR GAME!**

1. Make sure you have opened `DungeonoftheEndless.exe` at least once. This is an important step, as if you decide to reinstall, make sure you launch it before following the steps below. If you already have a previous version of `Partiality` installed, make sure you click the built-in `Uninstall Partiality` button until `Partiality` closes.

2. Download `Partiality.zip` and `Mods.zip` from [the releases page](https://github.com/sc2ad/DungeonOfTheEndless-Mod/releases)

3. Extract `Partiality.zip` to a safe place - this is how you will load mods into the game, do not lose it!

4. Run the `Partiality Launcher.bat` file, or if on a Mac, run the application located within the `bin` folder of the folder that you extracted.

**If you have installed Dungeon of the Endless in a different directory other than `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dungeon of the Endless` follow the steps below**

* Navigate to `File -> Open Game` (or press Ctrl-O)
* Navigate to your `DungeonoftheEndless.exe`. This is normally located at: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dungeon of the Endless`

5. Confirm that the `APPID` of Dungeon of the Endless is set to `249050`.

6. Click the `Apply Mods` Button (even though there are no mods!)

7. You may load your game as normal, and confirm there are no problems.

8. Copy any of the mods from `Mods.zip` and place them into the `Mods` folder at the same location as your `DungeonoftheEndless.exe`.

9. Return to `Partiality` (reopen it if closed) and click the `Refresh Mod List` option. You should see the mods that you copied over appear, along with a checkmark next to each of them.

10. Check on/off as many mods as you desire, then press `Apply Mods` and enjoy!

* Please note that you can change various configuration of these mods in their respective config files, which are generated (by default) in the directory with `DungeonoftheEndless.exe` after loading them for the first time.
