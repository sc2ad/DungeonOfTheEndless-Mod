# DungeonOfTheEndless-Mod

This is a compilation of some mods that I use for DotE and the framework to support them.

## Tutorial

There are a few steps that you must take in order to properly use these mods.

### Setup

**PLEASE FOLLOW THIS AS BEST AS YOU CAN, IF YOU DO NOT, THE MODS WON'T LOAD AND YOU MAY HAVE TO REINSTALL YOUR GAME!**

1. Make sure you have opened `DungeonoftheEndless.exe` at least once. This is an important step, as if you decide to reinstall, make sure you launch it before following the steps below. If you already have a previous version of `BepInEx` installed, be prepared to replace it.

2. Download `BepInEx.zip` and `Mods.zip` from [the releases page](https://github.com/sc2ad/DungeonOfTheEndless-Mod/releases)

3. Extract `BepInEx.zip` into your `DungeonoftheEndless.exe` folder, this is commonly located at: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dungeon of the Endless`

4. Run the game again, nothing should have changed (game-wise).

5. Copy any of the mods from `Mods.zip` and place them into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder at the same location as your `DungeonoftheEndless.exe`.

6. Run the game and enjoy your mods!

* If you have problems loading mods, contact me on Discord at: Sc2ad#8836 or open a GitHub Issue.

* Please note that you can change various configuration of these mods in their respective config files, which are generated (by default) in the `BepInEx/config` director after loading them for the first time.
