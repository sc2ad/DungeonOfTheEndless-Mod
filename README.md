# DungeonOfTheEndless-Mod
This is a compilation of some mods that I use for DotE.
Please make sure you install Partiality, and run Partiality according to its tutorial.
Then, place the DLL from the releases page in your Mods folder and click "Apply Mods" on Partiality.
Next, open up DotE and once you have entered the Dungeon, simply press the '\' key and the exit will appear, along with a message on one of the ways to get there.
This is tested on multiplayer as well!
